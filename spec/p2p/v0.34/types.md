## `base_reactor.go`

`Reactor` interface.

`BaseReactor` implements `Reactor`.

## `conn_set.go`

`ConnSet` interface, a "lookup table for connections and their ips".
Internal type `connSet` implements the `ConnSet` interface.

Used by the [transport](./transport.md) to store connected peers.

## `errors.go`

`ErrRejected` struct carries reasons for which a peer was rejected.

Other errors.

## `fuzz.go`

`FuzzedConnection` wraps a `net.Conn` and injects random delays.
For testing purposes.

Interface `IPeerSet` declares a subset of methods provided by `PeerSet`.
Type `PeerSet` implements the `IPeerSet` interface.

## `switch.go`

Documented in [switch.md](./switch.md).

## `transport.go`

The `Transport` interface is implemented by `MultiplexTransport`.

Documented in [transport.md](./transport.md).

## `types.go`
